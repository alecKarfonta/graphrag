## üìã Usage Guidelines

### Best Practices:

1. **Query Formulation**: Use clear, specific queries for better results
2. **Domain Specification**: Include domain context when extracting entities
3. **Error Handling**: Always check response status codes
4. **Performance**: Monitor response times for optimization

### Common Patterns:

1. **Factual Queries**: "What is X?" ‚Üí Use enhanced query processing
2. **Comparative Queries**: "Compare X and Y" ‚Üí Use comparative reasoning
3. **Causal Queries**: "What causes X?" ‚Üí Use causal reasoning
4. **Complex Queries**: "How does X relate to Y?" ‚Üí Use multi-hop reasoning

### Error Handling:

```python
import requests

try:
    response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/api/enhanced-query", 
                           params={"query": "What is machine learning?"})
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        result = response.json()
        print(f"Answer: {result['answer']}")
        print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']}")
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
        
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Connection error: {e}")
```

## üöÄ Performance Tips

1. **Batch Processing**: Use batch endpoints for multiple queries
2. **Caching**: Cache frequently requested results
3. **Async Processing**: Use async requests for better performance
4. **Monitoring**: Track response times and success rates

## üìä Performance Benchmarks

Based on recent testing:

- **Enhanced Query Processing**: ~8.8s average response time
- **Advanced Reasoning**: ~0.3s average response time
- **Entity Extraction**: ~0.4s average response time
- **Query Analysis**: ~2.0s average response time
- **Overall Success Rate**: 100%

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Empty Reasoning Results**: Knowledge graph may be empty
2. **Slow Response Times**: Check system resources
3. **Entity Extraction Issues**: Verify text format and domain
4. **Connection Errors**: Ensure all services are running

### Debug Steps:

1. Check health endpoint
2. Verify knowledge graph has data
3. Test entity extraction separately
4. Monitor system logs
5. Check service dependencies
