Machine Learning Relationships

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the broad field of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns in data. Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural networks that consist of interconnected nodes that process information.

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where algorithms learn from labeled training data to make predictions on new data. Unsupervised learning is another type of machine learning where algorithms find hidden patterns in unlabeled data.

The hierarchical relationship is: Artificial Intelligence contains Machine Learning, which contains Deep Learning. Neural Networks are the computational foundation that enables Deep Learning. Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning are different approaches within Machine Learning.

Key relationships:
- AI contains Machine Learning
- Machine Learning contains Deep Learning  
- Deep Learning uses Neural Networks
- Machine Learning includes Supervised Learning
- Machine Learning includes Unsupervised Learning
- Neural Networks enable Deep Learning
- Supervised Learning differs from Unsupervised Learning
